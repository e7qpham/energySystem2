## Electricity market modelling

This task aimed to build a simple electricity market model for minimising operational costs within technical constraints
for Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay using pyomo and pypsa tools

A take-away from this task is Brazil should take measures to increase the import capacity of hydro-electricity from
Bolivia and Paraguay. These can be implemented by:
1. Upgrading the existing transmission lines between these countries to bear higher voltage lines
2. Constructing new transmission lines if there are additional viable routes for electricity trade
The action to this import strategy can help Brazil diversify its energy mix towards a more sustainable source
while reducing the current big dependence on fossil fuel sources such as coal and gas.
